        <h1>How to make spicy tofu?</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's sort of a variation on mapo tofu, a popular Sichuan dish. Garlic is the star in this version, however, and it's also on the milder side. (We use sweet hoisin sauce in addition to spicy bean sauce, and don't use Sichuan peppercorns.) It's also easier to make!</p>
